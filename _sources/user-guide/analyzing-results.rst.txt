Analyzing Results
=================

SOFEA allows for post-processing of the model runs. The AERMOD model within
SOFEA has been enhanced by one additional type of output, in addition to the
PLOT, POST, and OUT files produced using the regulatory version of the
model. The additional output is in NetCDF format. The SOFEA post-processing tools
read a NetCDF output produced by the model run and has a built-in interface
for Analyzing Results. To use this capability, choose |AnalyzeResults| 
**Analyze Results** through the main menu or click the graph button 
|AnalyzeResults| in the toolbar. This opens the Analysis dialog box which allows 
opening a desired modeled output and calculating a number of statistics for
the concentration data set.
