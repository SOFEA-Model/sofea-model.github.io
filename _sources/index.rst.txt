Monitoring ambient air to assess environmental exposure and risk for 
volatile agricultural chemicals requires extensive resources and 
logistical effort. The cost and technical limitations of monitoring can 
be mitigated using a validated air dispersion model to simulate 
concentrations of volatile organic chemicals in ambient air. The SOil 
Fumigant Exposure Assessment (SOFEA) modeling system was developed to 
explore volatile pesticide exposure and bystander risk. SOFEA assembles 
sources and source strengths, uses weather data from the region of 
interest, and executes an air dispersion model (AERMOD) to simulate 
pesticide concentrations at user defined receptors that can be used in 
exposure and risk assessment.
