Monitoring ambient air to assess environmental exposure and risk for 
volatile agricultural chemicals requires extensive resources and 
logistical effort. The cost and technical limitations of monitoring can 
be mitigated using a validated air dispersion model to simulate 
concentrations of volatile organic chemicals in ambient air.

The SOil Fumigant Exposure Assessment (SOFEA) modeling system was 
developed to explore volatile pesticide exposure and bystander risk. 
SOFEA assembles sources and source strengths, uses weather data from the 
region of interest, and executes an air dispersion model (AERMOD) to 
simulate pesticide concentrations at user defined receptors that can be 
used in exposure and risk assessment.

The current version of SOFEA is 4.1.5-ALPHA. Downloads for Windows 64-bit
are available from `releases <https://github.com/SOFEA-Model/SOFEA/releases>`__.
Customized builds are available upon request.
